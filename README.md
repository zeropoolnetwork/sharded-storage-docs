# Blockchain Sharded Storage Solution

## Overview

This repository hosts the documentation for a novel sharded storage solution for blockchain, aimed at achieving Web2 costs and Web3 security levels. Utilizing Shamir's Secret Sharing and Fast Fourier Transform, this approach addresses the scalability issues of blockchain storage, enabling the storage of data volumes beyond petabytes.

## Abstract

The document outlines a strategy for horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant storage within the blockchain ecosystem. By leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques, it proposes a method to reduce the need for on-chain storage of rollup blocks, potentially upgrading validiums to rollups without compromising on security or cost.
